# E2E and CMS (ml4sci) Evaluation Tasks
Chenguang Guan's solutions to ml4sci GSoC evaluation tests (E2E and CMS)

I have completed:
1. Solutions to Task 1 (both in pytorch and TensorFlow). The pytorch note includes more details and discussion.
2. Solution to Task 2 (in pytorch).
3. Solution to Additional Task (Vision Transformer) (in pytorch): Vision Transformers for End-to-End Particle Identification with the CMS Experiment

The solutions to Graph Neural Network project and Equivariant Neural Network will be updated in the following days.

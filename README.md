# E2E and CMS (ml4sci) Evaluation Tasks
Chenguang Guan's solutions to ml4sci GSoC evaluation tests (E2E and CMS)

There are five notebooks:

1. Task-1 (2 files): E2E_and_CMS_task1_pytorch.ipynb ; E2E_and_CMS_task1_tensorflow.ipynb
2. Task-2 (1 file): E2E_and_CMS_task2.ipynb
3. Additional Task (2 files): E2E_and_CMS_Additional_Task_ViT.ipynb ; E2E_and_CMS_Additional_Task_ViT_Bonus.ipynb

I have completed:
1. Solutions to Task 1 (both in pytorch and TensorFlow). The pytorch note includes more details and discussion.
2. Solution to Task 2 (in pytorch).
3. Solution to Additional Task (Vision Transformer) (in pytorch): Vision Transformers for End-to-End Particle Identification with the CMS Experiment
4. Supplement to Additional Task: I introduce a DIY version of ViT, and discuss the post-norm and pre-norm. I also implement the MLP-mixer model.

p.s.: The solutions to Graph Neural Network project and Equivariant Neural Network will be updated in the following days.
